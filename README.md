Welcome to my first real project on GitHub. The goal is to creat a Dungeons and Dragons stlye of game that can be played in a computer terminal. The program randomly generates a 'virus' that the user will battle through text-commands in the computer terminal. The user can go through the process of 'rolling' for their hero's statistics. The user will be able to add a description of their character and will be able to decide on their actions throughout the battle!

Check out my progress and feel free to suggest any upgrades to the code!
